# My DSA Journey

A concise, practical guide to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey — goals, study plan, resources, and projects. This README documents what I learn, how I practice, and the milestones I'm working toward.

## TL;DR

- **Goal:** Build strong problem-solving skills, master common data structures and algorithms, and complete meaningful projects and interview preparation.
- **Approach:** Learn fundamentals → implement structures → solve problems daily → build projects → review and iterate.

## Why DSA?

DSA improves how you reason about problems, design efficient solutions, and write code that scales. It's essential for technical interviews and for building reliable software.

## My Learning Path

1. Foundations
   - Big-O notation, time & space complexity
   - Recursion and iteration patterns
2. Core Data Structures
   - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
   - Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables
   - Trees (binary, BST), Heaps, Tries
   - Graphs (representations, traversals)
3. Algorithms
   - Sorting and searching
   - Two pointers, sliding window
   - Divide & conquer, dynamic programming
   - Greedy algorithms
   - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
4. Problem-Solving Practice
   - Start with easy problems, progress to medium/hard
   - Learn templates and patterns, then generalize

## Weekly Practice Plan

- Daily: 45–90 minutes solving problems (mix of easy/medium)
- Weekly: 2–3 focused deep sessions (data structure implementations, hard problems)
- Monthly: Complete one small project or guided course module

## Platforms I Use

- LeetCode — targeted interview-style practice
- HackerRank / CodeSignal — fundamentals and timed practice
- GeeksforGeeks — conceptual explanations and examples
- Books: "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS), "Grokking Algorithms"

## Projects & Milestones

- Implement a personal library of data structures in your preferred language
- Build a visualizer for common algorithms (sorting, BFS/DFS)
- Create a mini search engine or pathfinder using graph algorithms
- Prepare a curated list of 50 interview problems and master them

## Study Tips

- Understand the why before coding — complexity, invariants, edge cases
- Write clean, tested implementations of each data structure
- Discuss solutions with peers or write short explanations after solving
- Use spaced repetition for common patterns and tricks

## How to Use This Repo

- Add problem solutions inside language-specific folders (e.g., `Arrays/`, `LinkedList/`).
- Keep each solution small, with a short comment describing the approach and complexity.
- Add small README notes for larger modules or projects.

## Contributing

If you want to collaborate, open an issue or submit a PR with:

- A clear problem or feature description
- Test cases or links to the problem (if applicable)
- A concise commit message explaining the change

If you'd like, I can also:

- add a template for problem files
- create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
- scaffold example solutions and tests

Good luck on your DSA journey — consistency beats intensity. Keep solving!
